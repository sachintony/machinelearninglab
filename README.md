<h1>This dataset captures the relationship between home cost and average income across geographic regions of the United States over time.

Ultimately I intend to augment this dataset with relevant
economic indicators from Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) to better elucidate insights
about the US Real Estate Market, the status of the US Economy, and the interaction between
these constructs.</h1>
